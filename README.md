# NeighbourLink
## Coursera Capstone for Applied Data Science: Battle of the Neighborhoods

### Aim of this analysis is to explore how similar or dissimilar their neighbourhoods are based on Foursquare location data.

NeighbourLink is a data science project hosted on GitHub that aims to help people who are moving from Hamburg to Berlin to decide which neighborhood they should move to based on their current neighborhood. The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the characteristics of neighborhoods in Hamburg and Berlin and provides recommendations based on the user's current neighborhood.

The project uses a variety of data sources, including Foursquare location data and demographic data, to identify patterns and similarities between neighborhoods in Hamburg and Berlin. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering, NeighbourLink groups similar neighborhoods together and provides recommendations based on the user's current neighborhood.

The aim of the project is to provide users with a better understanding of the characteristics of different neighborhoods in Berlin based on their current neighborhood in Hamburg. This information can be used to make an informed decision about which neighborhood to move to and to ensure a smoother transition to a new city.

### Overall, NeighbourLink is a valuable project for people who are planning to move from Hamburg to Berlin and are looking for guidance on which neighborhood to move to. By analyzing neighborhood characteristics and providing recommendations based on the user's current neighborhood, NeighbourLink makes it easier for users to make an informed decision about where to move.
