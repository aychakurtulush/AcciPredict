# AcciPredict
## Coursera Capstone for Applied Data Science: Battle of the Neighborhoods

### Aim of this analysis is to explore how similar or dissimilar their neighbourhoods are based on Foursquare location data.

AcciPredict is a machine learning project hosted on GitHub that was developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in building and deploying a machine learning model using real-world data to predict the severity of car accidents.

The project focuses on the analysis of a variety of factors, including weather conditions, road conditions, and the time of day to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the severity of accidents. The project uses a combination of data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, including scikit-learn and XGBoost, to build a model that accurately predicts the severity of accidents.

AcciPredict's user-friendly interface and well-documented code make it easy to use and understand for students and researchers interested in learning more about machine learning and its applications in real-world scenarios. By working with real-world data and building a model to predict the severity of accidents, students gain valuable experience in the practical application of machine learning techniques.

### Overall, AcciPredict is a valuable project for students and researchers who are interested in learning more about machine learning and its practical applications. With its focus on predicting the severity of car accidents and its use of real-world data, AcciPredict provides students with the skills and experience they need to succeed in the field of machine learning.
